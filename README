This repository contains classes used in order to process data files and train
discriminative classifiers (Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) in an automated manner.

For Neural Network training it uses the SNNS Software (http://www.ra.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/SNNS/).

For Support Vector Machines it uses SVM Light and SVM Multiclass owned by Thorsten Joachims (http://svmlight.joachims.org/).

Please see the bin directories for sample scripts used in order to train classifiers massively with the developed software.

Also ARN_TRR_Report and RN_TRR_Report contain documentation (generated in Latex) regarding the usage of the software.
