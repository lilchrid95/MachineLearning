\section{Introduction}

\par The application of Support Vector Machines to uni - dimensionally multi-spectral representation of a 3x3 pixel matrix of an image section to recognize terrain type of the central pixel is considered in this course project.
\\
\par The use of Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis is quite established for the task of satellite image classification. In this course project we consider the classification of terrain types.


\subsection{Data}

\par A Landsat MSS image consists of four digital images of the same zone using different spectral bands. Two of the bands are in the visible region (corresponding approximately to green and red regions of the visible spectrum) while the other two are in the (near) infra-red. Each pixel is represented as a 8-bit binary word, with 0 corresponding to black and 255 to white. The spatial resolution of a pixel is approximately 80m x 80m. Each image contains 2340 x 3380 such pixels.
\\
\par The database used in the course project is a sub-area of a scene, consisting of 82 x 100 pixels. Each line of data corresponds to a 3x3 square neighborhood of pixels completely contained within the 82x100 sub-area. Each line contains the pixel values in the four spectral bands (converted to ASCII) of each of the 9 pixels in the 3x3 neighborhood and a number indicating the classification label of the central pixel. As per the original database the number is a code for the following classes:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item red soil
	\item cotton crop
	\item grey soil
	\item damp grey soil
	\item soil with vegetation stubble
	\item mixture class ( all types present)
	\item very damp grey soil
\end{enumerate}

\par Further preprocessing has been performed to the data provided to us. It has been normalized and as there are no records of the 6th type the classes label have been moved so that type 7 is represented by the label 6. 

\par We have been provided with two data partitions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item sat6c.tra: Training set formed by 2000 records with the following composition:	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Class 1: 466
		\item Class 2: 216
		\item Class 3: 429
		\item Class 4: 195
		\item Class 5: 226
		\item Class 6: 468
	\end{itemize}
	\item sat6c.public.tst: Public test set containing of 1000 records with the following composition: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Class 1: 234
		\item Class 2: 106
		\item Class 3: 208
		\item Class 4: 98
		\item Class 5: 118
		\item Class 6: 236
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Scope}

\par As part of the course project we will train classifiers for the landstat task described in the above sections. To be more precise we will use the following techniques:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Support Vector Machines:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Multi class algorithm 
			\item Combination of two class classifier
		\end{itemize}
	\item For both SVM techniques we will use the following Kernels:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Polynomial Kernel: \begin{math} (\ s\ a*b +c)^d\end{math}
		\item Radial Basis Function Kernel: \begin{math} exp(\ -gamma\ ||a-b||^2) \end{math}
		\item Sigmoid Kernel: \begin{math} tanh(\ s\ a*b + c) \end{math}		
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\par All training classification will be performed with the sat6c.tra data and the best obtained classifiers will be evaluated against the sat6c.public.tst data set, which is not used for training nor for partial evaluation/guidance of the performance during the experimentation. 

\section{Development}

\par In this section we will describe the software framework developed in order to perform the experimentations for the task. The framework developed allows us to load, format and perform transformations with specific data sets and also launch classifier training with different classifiers and obtain mean test set classification error with cross validation. 

For the development of the framework we have used:
\begin{itemize}
	\item SVM Light and SVM Multiclass developed by Thorsten Joachims.
	\item Ruby scripting language 1.9.2
	\item Ruby libraries:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Awesome print: to print outputs in a more human readable manner.
		\item Open 3: to allow us to connect to the input, output and error streams of an executed command
		\item Date: to retrieve the current date and time in order to time stamp files. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Structure}

\par The software is structured into the following classes:
\begin{description}
	\item[DataPattern:] The DataPattern class is defined in the \textit{./lib/data\_pattern.rb} file. It encapsulates a sample record of class containing the actual data ( can be in numeric or string representations) and the class label. It allows us to perform the following operations: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Order to records by label value.
		\item Iterate over the different values of the vector.
		\item Duplicate the record.
	\end{itemize}
	\item[DataSet:] The DataSet class can be found in the \textit{./lib/data\_set.rb} file. It represents a whole set of records of a task allowing us to perform the following tasks over them:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Read the original data from a file and apply specific format to them to prepare them for the ML tool. e.g. Uniform the chain length for a Chromosome classification task. 
		\item Write them to file using an specific format for a Machine Learning toolset.
		\item Partition the set into blocks ensuring correct representation and number of each class in the block.
		\item Combine different sets in an additive manner.
		\item Sort the set by class label.
		\item Shuffle the set.
		\item Filter the set to a sub set of labels/classes.
		\item Binarize labels so that they can be sent to 2-class limited classifiers. 
	\end{itemize}
	\item[Svm:] The Svm class can be found in the \textit{./lib/svm.rb} file. It is an object wrapper for the svm light and svm multiclass developed by Thorsten Joachims and allows us to perform the following tasks from the framework:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The class allows as input an experiment object, and performs a classification with the svm light or svm multiclass algorithms. 
		\item Permits the evaluation of a test set and returns us the classification error obtained.
		\item Permits the classification of a test pattern by saving it to a temporary file and returns us the estimated class.
	\end{itemize}
	\item[SvmFileWriter:] The class can be found in the \textit{./lib/svm.rb} file. The file writer is in charge of performing header and footer special formatting for the SVM toolset. In this case it creates the pattern file and just adds a \#EOF at the end of the file as the SVM commands used do not require any other file formatting.
	\item[SvmPatternWriter:] Can be found in \textit{./lib/svm.rb}. The pattern writer in in charge of performing special formatting to the patterns required for correct usage on the desired toolset. In this case the label is printed at the beginning and each of the dimensions value is preceded by the relative position of the dimension inside the feature space as the selected SVM toolset enforces sparse vector representation.
	\item[SvmCombinations] Coded in \textit{./lib/svm\_combinations.rb}. The class represents a multiclass classifier that is made up from the combination of two class classifiers in a directed acyclic graph (Plat, Cristianini \& Shawe-Taylor 2000). The class allows us to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Generate the specific data sets required to train each of the 2-class SVMs to implement the DAGSVM.
		\item Train and store the 2-class classifiers of the DAGSVM.
		\item Permits the evaluation of a test set and returns us the classification error obtained.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item[Parameter:] Coded in \textit{./lib/parameter.rb}. The class allows us to define a parameter and a range of values of variation. The values can be a set of strings, if for example we want to vary between different neural network files or a numeric value, to study an specific range of the momentum parameter. 
	\item[Experiment:] Present in the file \textit{./lib/experiment.rb}. It is an specific configuration, value set, of the parameters that will be executed on the chosen ML tool set and the value will be averaged over cross experimentation. 
	\item[Study:] contained in \textit{./lib/study.rb}. It generates the set of experiments by performing combinations of each of the values for each parameter described and runs them writing the results and studies performed in specific files. 
\end{description}
\subsection{Library Options}

\par With the defined software structure we can easily perform studies on an indicated task by just having to write the specific
read and write formatters for the task. Next we will show a short example of the framework scripts used to DAGSVMs
for the terrain classification task: 

\lstset{basicstyle=\footnotesize,language=Ruby}
\lstset{linewidth=500pt}
\lstset{numbers=left, stepnumber=1}
\lstset{commentstyle=\color{blue}, stringstyle=\color{green},showspaces=false}
\lstset{keywordstyle=\color{red}\bfseries\emph}
\lstset{frame=trBL,frameround=tttt}
\lstinputlisting[caption=chromosome.rb,label=lst:lowertri]{../bin/svm_comb.rb}

\subsection{Software Output}

\par The software generates the following output files that will help us out for the review of the classification training:

\begin{description}

\end{description}


\section{Experimental Results}
\subsection{Experimentation Methodology}

\par For the SVMs experiments a cross validation over 5 blocks will be performed for each experiment. The data will be composed of the public training data: sat6c.tra

\par Once selected the best resulting parameters for each of the SVM algorithms and Kernels we will perform a final evaluation by performing training a SVM with the whole of sat6c.tra and test it against the public test set sat6c.public.tst.

\par We will not use sat6c.public.tst other than for final evaluation to ensure that we not indirectly over fit the set by using it when exploring the solution space.

\section{Conclusions}

\par As we have seen in the previous tasks the best results have been obtained for the Radial based learning. The best results for each algorithm in the private test set has been as follows: 

\begin{table}[H] 
\caption{Private test set - best error results for training algorithms} %title of the table

10.40 & 15.50 &  9.60 \\

\hline 
\end{tabular} 
\label{tab:dist_result} 
\end{table}

\par We have obtained the best results for Back-propagation and Radial based learning, being our radial network the network with least classification task in the board.

\par In future work it would be interesting to use the SVM software that has been integrated in the framework to study this task.
