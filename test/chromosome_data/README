Dear colleagues,

You said you wanted a copy of our chromosome database. Actually,
it consists of raw profile data plus a multi-option program for 
extracting and encoding string sequences. To ensure compatibility, 
I forward you a copy of the string encodings that we use rather 
than the raw data itself.  For details you will have to see some 
of the references given below. 

We do ask that you make reference to the following paper if, or when, 
publishing results based on this data:

@article(Lundsteen-al80,
    author = "C Lundsteen and J Phillip and E Granum",
    title = "Quantitative analysis of 6985 digitized trypsin 
	    {G}-banded human metaphase chromosomes",
    journal = "Clinical Genetics",
    volume = 18,
    pages = "355-370",
    year = 1980
)

In addition to this reference to the Copenhagen database, as it
has become known, you should include one of the following papers
(or both) as a reference to the profile processing:

@incollection(Granum-al89,
    author = "E Granum and M G Thomason and J Gregor",
    title = "On the use of automatically inferred {M}arkov networks 
	    for chromosome analysis",
    pages = "233--251"
    editor = "C Lundsteen and J Piper",
    booktitle = "Automation of Cytogenetics",
    publisher = "Springer-Verlag",
    address = "Berlin",
    year = 1989
)

@article(GraTho90,
    author = "E Granum and M G Thomason",
    title = "Automatically inferred {M}arkov network models for
	   classification of chromosomal band pattern structures",
    journal = "Cytometry",
    volume = 11, 
    pages = "26--39", 
    year = 1990
)

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to try and provide an 
answer. But if the question pertains to the raw data or details of
the profile processing, then I suggest that you contact Erik Granum 
(my Ph.D. advisor). He can be reached as eg@vision.auc.dk. He may
also be able to help you if you want to find out about the much 
larger database that I mentioned (which may or may not exist).

The database consists of 44 files, e.g., dif22da,
that each have 100 lines of the form

/ 5467 119 22 27 9 /    AA==a==E===d==A==a=Aa=A=a=b

where 5467 is a unique chromosome identifier, 119 refers to the 
metaphase the sample came from (1..180), 22 is the chromosome type, 
27 is the overall string length, and 9 is the length of the p-arm,
i.e., the centromere position. The slashes are, of course, only
delimiters and should be ignored, i.e., the alphabet consists of
the letters a-f, A-F, and = (it may a-e and A-E, I forget).

I will be looking forward to hearing back from you once you have
had a chance to apply your methods to the data. As a matter of
fact, I'll be happy find our classification or centromere finding 
results so that we can make a detailed performance comparison.
The papers (cf. the ICGI paper for refs.) only report averages.

Sincerely,
Jens Gregor
